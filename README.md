#UNTITLED-JAVASCRIPT-PROJECT

This project will showcase a single-page app using html, css, and javascript to provide for interactive elements.

The single-page app will be a graphing calculator which will be able to evaluate functions as well as draw graphs of those functions where required.

The project itself will deploy a model-view-controller design pattern, separating the logic from the user input and the view aspects.

This Project was submitted as Milestone Project 2 as part of the developer's studies with the Code Institute.
