# JSCALC

This project will showcase a single-page app using html, css, and javascript to provide for interactive elements.

The single-page app will be a graphing calculator which will be able to evaluate functions as well as draw graphs of those functions where required.

The project itself will deploy a model-view-controller design pattern, separating the logic from the user input and the view aspects.

This Project was submitted as Milestone Project 2 as part of the developer's studies with the Code Institute.

## Design and Development

### User Stories

As a user, I want:

1. to input numbers into the calculator
2. to perform operations on the numbers I input
3. to have the correct answer of those operations displayed to me
4. for the calculator to have a user friendly interface
5. to be able to perform algebraic operations with the calculator
6. to draw graphs with the calculator
7. to have the calculator have a dark mode
8. to allow me to change the colors of the calculator display
9. to provide an easy way for me to convert values (e.g. imperial to metric)

### Strategy

The strategy plane of UX design concerns itself with high-level decisions about the product and trade-offs between features to be developed now and others to be developed later. Compare feasibility of features with importance.

### Scope

The scope follows on from the strategy plane. Here we focus on developing features in small, incremental blocks until we have a finished or viable product. This permits the realistic budgeting of time and the development of products quickly and effectively.

### Structure

Progressing down the planes, the developer moves from the abstract to the concrete as part of the eternal struggle by humanity to make its desires manifest. Does this mean that all developers are closeted Hegelians? Maybe mad platonists? Who knows? You are still reading this. Why?

The structure plane involves the detailing of how each feature will work together in the project.

### Skeleton

Here we begin to design the interface and the navigation of the product. This should be a natural follow-on from above. Why? Because a bunch of articles, books and papers from a self-styled experts on UX design tell us it should be so. Anyway, this is the bit where you figure out how many distinct html files you will need to write, where to put a nav-bar, and all that stuff. Invariably the nav bar will be at the top, and will transform to a burger menu on mobile. There you have it.

### Surface

Colours (colors for all those US english types), typography, pictures, animations: all the pretty stuff that people like and that marketing firms charge a ransom for. These go on the surface plane and should reinforce the previous planes. If you are a wannabe developer, like myself, the golden thread of the previous planes will inevitably some SAAS money-for-old-rope scheme which the surface layer will bravely attempt to mask. Or it might be a blockchain/coin scam or one of those 'tech' companies that is really just an attempt to circumvent labour protections and regulation with an app. But a pretty font, an endless scroller webpage and some one-word marketing spiel might be enough to turn you into a unicorn, thus proving there are people who are just too rich to invest prudently.

## Features

### Features to be implemented

- Calculation functions: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, exponents, square root etc. - Javascript functions & classes
- Display buttons, inputs, results of operations - HTML & CSS
- User input - handled by javascript, html

The above features correspond to model, view, controller design pattern. The calculation functions are the model, containing the logic and manipulating the data. The display corresponds to the view, displaying the information the user sees. The user input is the controller, allowing the user to interact with the programme and obtain their desired results.

## Testing

Devise tests as we go along with recordings or pictures to demonstrate operations.

Model Tests:

- Addition function adds two numbers together. Addition is commutative.

- Subtraction function deducts the right-most number from the leftmost. 

- Multiplication yields the product of the left and right numbers.

- Division yields the product of the inverse of the right-most number by the left-most.

- Divide by zero errors are caught and prevented.\

- Non-integers are caught and prevented.
